        <p>The report was writed by John but not reviewed proper.
Many peoples in the team doesnâ€™t knows the correct process.
Errors have been maked in the document which should of been avoided.
The client was telling that the deliverables is delay.
We was suppose to finished the task last week, but it were not done.
Some of the feedbacks are ignored by management without no explanation.
The communication between teams are poor, leading to confusions.
It is expected that improvements will happened but nothing were done.</p>
